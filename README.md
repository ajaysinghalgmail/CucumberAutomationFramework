# CucumberAutomationFramework
This is the best BDD (cucumber) automation framework that generates two types of famous reports i.e. (1) extent reports and (2) cucumber reports.
Moreover, when a scenario fails, a screenshot will be taken which helps in identification of the issues. I have used, Maven, Junit (TestNG can also be used), Selenium, JVM Reports Plugin, Extent reports plugin and other required dependencies that can be found in the attacehd pom file.
