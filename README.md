# Selenium Webdriver with Cucumber BDD Automation Framework
This is a testing automation framework that uses the following tech stack:
Selenium Webdriver, Java, Maven, Junit, Page Object Model, BDD, Cucumber and extent reports.
It generates both types of famous reports i.e. (1) extent reports and (2) cucumber reports after execution of each scenario.
Moreover, when a feature scenario fails, a screenshot will be taken which helps in identification of the issues. I have used, Maven, Junit (TestNG can also be used), Selenium, JVM Reports Plugin, Extent reports plugin and other required dependencies that can be found in the attached pom file.
